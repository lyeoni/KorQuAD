# KorQuAD
QA system for KorQuAD (Korean Question Answering Dataset) using BERT

## Submission

To get official scores on the KorQuAD test set, we must submit(or upload) our model to the [CodaLab](https://worksheets.codalab.org/). This is because the integrity of test results should be preserved.

Here's a detailed process that guides you through the official evaluation of our model.
